/*   Special auction
Typically in an auction, the highest bidder determines the price of an item. In this special auction,
if there's no bidder for an item, the item is automatically sold to the auction house at the minimum
price.

In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, you're given an auctionPrice() function
that accepts a nullable Bid? type as an argument:

Complete the auctionPrice() function so that the program prints these lines:
Item A is sold at 5000.
Item B is sold at 3000.
 */

fun main() {
    val winningBid = Bid(5000, "Private Collector")

    println("Item A is sold at ${auctionPrice(winningBid, 2000)}.")
    println("Item B is sold at ${auctionPrice(null, 3000)}.")
    println("Item C is sold at ${auctionPrice2(null, 1000)}.")
}

class Bid(val amount: Int, val bidder: String)

fun auctionPrice(bid: Bid?, minimumPrice: Int): Int = bid?.amount ?: minimumPrice

fun auctionPrice2(bid: Bid?, minimumPrice: Int): Int {
    return bid?.amount ?: minimumPrice
    /*
    return if(bid != null){
        bid.amount
    }else{
        minimumPrice
    }
     */
